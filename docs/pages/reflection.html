      <p>
        In the end our project worked as intended. We certainly had some issues
        along the way such as accidentally graphing the headings incorrectly.
        Time management was an issue for us, we strive to improve our time
        management skills in future projects. On the other hand, using github to
        track and save our progress worked extremely well. It kept all of our
        resources in one place and enabled us to collaborate effectively. If we
        had more time we would definitely expand and enhance the Python code by
        adding features such as a dynamic year range selector and more choice in
        types of graph for example only 1st quarters or exclude clothing.
