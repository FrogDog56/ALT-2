    <h2>Investigate</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The dataset that we chose is a UK Consumer Dataset from the years 1997 -
        2022. This is a vast dataset so we had narrow down what areas of the
        data we sought to analyse. We decided to only anaylse the data between
        the years 1997 and 2017 as we felt as if 20 years was a sufficient
        sample period of time. Another reason fro omitting the years from 2018 -
        2022 was the COVID-19 pandemic that shock the global economy,
        subsequently affecting the consumer spending.

      <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>
        We aim to investigate how time of year affects consumer spending across
        different categories. We aim to investigate 3 categories in total. As a
        by-product of our investigation we should be able to observe a steady
        rise in spending since 1997. This rise can be attributed to many factors
        with the main one being inflation.

      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>
        We utilized <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">kaggle</a> to peruse a
        vast range of datasets until we found ours. We looked at many datasets
        including: Chicago Crime Stats, Student SAT scores and 2016 election exit polls. We landed on our Consumer dataset in the end as we
        believed that it contained a sufficient amount of data to anaylse
        multiple areas of the topic. An attribute which the others lacked.
