    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
        The dataset that we chose is a UK Consumer Dataset from the years 1997 -
        2022. This is a vast dataset so we had narrow down what areas of the data
        we sought to analyse. We decided to only anaylse the data between the
        years 1997 and 2017 as we felt as if 20 years was a sufficient sample
        period of time. Another reason fro omitting the years from 2018 - 2022 was
        the COVID-19 pandemic that shock the global economy, subsequently
        affecting the consumer spending.
