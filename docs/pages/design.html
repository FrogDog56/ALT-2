      <h3>Code Design</h3>
      <p>
        We used Python 3 to analyse the data. We chose snake_case as our
        variable and function naming convention throughout this project

      <h3>Types of graphs</h3>
      <p>
        We decided to go with line graphs as we thought it would display our
        data appropriately. The line graph allows us to easily identify spikes
        and dips in consumer spending. Furthermore, line graphs allow us to
        display 80 quarters in total spanning across 20 years on one graph.
        Something that can not be achieved on a bar graphs or pie chart for
        example.
