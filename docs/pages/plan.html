    <h2>Plan</h2>

      <h3>Outline Plan</h3>
      <p>
        We plan to use the python pandas library to parse and clean the csv
        data. Then we will use the matplotlib.pyplot library to draw appropriate
        graphs using the data.

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        We faced a number of challenges while working on this project. The
        hardest part of this project was deciding on what dataset to anaylse.
        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> contains a large
        variety of datasets, it is overwhelming if you don't know exactly what
        you are looking for.

      <h3>Feasibility</h3>
      <p>
        In order to ensure our project was feasible we had to chose 3 categories
        from our dataset of 21 categories. We chose to anaylse: Food and
        non-alcholic beverages, Clothing and Footwear and Restaurants and Hotels
